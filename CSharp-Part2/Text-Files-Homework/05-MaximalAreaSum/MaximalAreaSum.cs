Problem 5. Maximal area sum
    • Write a program that reads a text file containing a square matrix of numbers.
    • Find an area of size  2 x 2  in the matrix, with a maximal sum of its elements. 
        ◦ The first line in the input file contains the size of matrix  N .
        ◦ Each of the next  N  lines contain  N  numbers separated by space.
        ◦ The output should be a single number in a separate text file.
Example:

  input       output

 4 
 2 3 3 4 
 0 2 3 4        17
 3 7 1 2 
 4 3 3 2
