Problem 13. C# and .NET Differences
	• Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences.
	• Write your description in a text file called  “csharp-and-dot-net-framework.txt” . Use English.

.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes
a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language 
can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework 
execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as Common Language Runtime (CLR), 
an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. 
FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework. FCL provides user interface, data access, database connectivity, 
cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications. Programmers produce 
software by combining their own source code with .NET Framework and other libraries.

C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, 
object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within
its .NET initiative.
